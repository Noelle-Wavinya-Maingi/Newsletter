## My process

### What I learned

This project provided practice in building a responsive newsletter sign-up form with form validation and a success message modal. I learned how to structure the HTML for such a form, style it using CSS and Tailwind CSS, and add interactivity with JavaScript. Key learnings include:

- Implementing form validation using JavaScript
- Displaying a success message after form submission
- Creating a modal for displaying success message

### Continued development

I plan to further enhance this project by:

- Adding more advanced form validation techniques
- Implementing backend functionality for storing submitted emails
- Improving the accessibility of the form and modal
